# CHR_TentTempFix

wetNreckless
@Server Owners I have created a Temporary Exile Fix for the 2 tents that do not spawn loot. All you need to do is unzip the file, place the a3_custom.pbo in your 

@ExileServer/addons folder, then just add the loot positions I 

have included into 

@ExileServer/addons/exile_server_config/config.cpp. 

Thank is it, easy.
